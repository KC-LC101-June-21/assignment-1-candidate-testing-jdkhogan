# Candidate-Testing

Part 1 collects the candidate's name and prints a greeting. It then prompts the candidate to answer a question: "Who was the first woman in space?" and lets them know if they were correct.

Part 2 builds out the questionnaire by using arrays and for loops to ask multiple questions and return a corrected test.

Part 3 checks answers and grade the quiz, then builds and displays a report.
